# AGE OF EMPIRES 4 GAME STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Age Of Empires 4 is a very complex real-time strategy game set in the middle-ages where players require immense knowledge about many mechanics of the game to perform competitively. At the time of the most recent season, AOE4 has 16 unique civilizations and ~30 maps; each civilization with unique bonuses, units, upgrades, and approaches to gameplay, each map with unique resources, land/sea formations, and a range of geographical difference. 

## Project Overview

#### The problem
Parts of the AOE4 community have expressed their concerns about a variety of things: some civilizations are too strong, some maps are overtly advantageous to some civilizations, and some unique upgrades of exclusive units are overpowered. 
Arguments the balance of civilziations are ongoing, and with every patch, the developers buff or nerf different parts of the game to attmept at making the game more balanced and fair for players. **But with so much emotional biases in ranked play and many game factors to consider, how can we determine if the game really is balanced or not?**
